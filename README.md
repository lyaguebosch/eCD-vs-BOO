Code for the paper:  
[Yet to be published]

## Overview

This repository contains the source code used in our simulations for the paper.  
Specifically, it includes:

- Functions to recreate the original Saffman protocol
- Functions to construct counterdiabatic and effective counterdiabatic (eCD) Hamiltonians
- Functions for numerical optimization using the Boulder Opal (BOO) Package
- Simulations of the eCD and BOO gate for different protocol times and pulse scalings
- Stability analysis of the eCD and BOO gates
- Notebooks to visually compare both gates and recreate the plots used in the paper
